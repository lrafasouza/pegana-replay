# Contributing

This repo is **mirrored automatically** from a closed sibling repo by a
path-filtered subtree-push action. Direct edits to `pegana-replay/main` are
overwritten on the next sync; please do not open PRs against it unless you've
talked to us first.

## What we accept

- **Issues**: open one on Telegram at [@PeganaWatchBot](https://t.me/PeganaWatchBot)
  rather than in this tracker. The Telegram channel routes to a human; the
  GitHub issue tracker on this repo is not actively monitored yet.

- **Methodology changes**: route through an ADR. Open the discussion on
  Telegram, then propose a new file under `docs/adr/` with the rationale,
  alternatives considered, and chosen design. Once accepted, the change lands
  in the private repo and the next sync mirrors it here.

- **CLI ergonomics fixes** (replay-cli error messages, output formatting,
  exit-code handling): we'll happily review proposals on Telegram and land
  them via the private repo.

- **Documentation polish** on this README or the ADRs: same workflow — open
  on Telegram, we'll land it.

## What we do NOT accept

- Direct edits to `crates/methodology/` that change peg-risk math without an
  ADR. The methodology version is part of every receipt — silently changing
  it would break replay for any receipt produced under the old rules.

- Engine, dispatcher, indexer, API, MCP, or bot changes — none of those
  components live here. They're operational surface in the closed repo.

## Versioning + receipts

The `methodology_version` field embedded in every audit receipt points at a
git tag in *this* repo of the form `methodology-vX.Y.Z`. If you're asked to
"verify against the methodology used to produce this receipt," check out the
matching tag — that's the canonical state at the time the engine emitted the
alert.

## Security

If you find a vulnerability that affects receipt validity or the on-chain
commit pipeline, please report it privately via Telegram before any public
disclosure.
